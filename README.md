# ML-Challenge-Land-Classification-
There are multiple satellites that capture the data about the amount of light intensity reflected at different frequencies from the Earth at a very granular geographic level. Some of this information can be used to classify the Earth into different buckets - built-up, barren, green or water. So for this problem, we have created training data with different parameters classified into the 4 classes. Now we want to classify the rest of the data in either of these classes.  Consider that you have no information about what these column names mean. Evaluate the suitability of the provided dataset for neural network based methods and provide cons, if any. Further, build a supervised classification model using deep learning techniques to classify the entire data into built-up, barren, green or water. We expect you to play with the data, plot some graphs and see what makes sense; instead of blindly applying a black-box model.
